# Apache Spark

### Overview
- Introduction to Apache Spark
- Build and Monitor Apache Spark Applications
- Advanced Apache Spark

### Description
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It is used for processing and analyzing a large amount of data. Just like Hadoop MapReduce, it also works with the system to distribute data across the cluster and process the data in parallel.
